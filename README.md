  Cryptographic Keys Generation and Transmission for Secured Communications

  The security of information transmissions is becoming a critical issue, encountered more and more in a world entering the digital age. Data encryption is necessary in order to achieve this. The RSA cryptographic system is an efficient solution that is nowadays widely used, and well-known for its robustness. However, we canâ€™t be ensured that none of the elements of the encryption chain has a malicious behavior, such as closed-source libraries, dedicated machine instructions, or an intrusive supervision of the operations by the BIOS. Therefore, we intend to implement a complete process of secured communications, whose elements would be mastered as much as possible. We would have a control of this process from the randomness generator used for the encryption keys generation, to the communication of the encrypted message. Our system would be used in the case where a party has one or several messages to safely transmit to another party. These messages would have a low lifespan (less than an hour), allowing the encryption keys to be relatively weak. However, the exchange of the encryption keys will have to be done on a safe channel, different from the one used for communications, thanks to a close-by optical transmission for example. This exchange of keys is the paramount point in so far as the security of the communications mostly rely on these keys.
